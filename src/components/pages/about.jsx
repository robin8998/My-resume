            Hi, I’m Robin Singh – a passionate front-end developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I recently stepped into the world of web development and love crafting user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing web applications.

I’ve also explored tools like React Redux, React Router, and Appwrite to build full-stack projects, including my personal blog platform. I enjoy turning ideas into real-world projects and continuously learning to improve my skills.

Currently, I’m diving deeper into responsive design, UI/UX principles, and backend integration to become a more well-rounded developer. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring design inspiration or learning something new in tech.

I’m excited to collaborate, contribute, and grow in the tech space. Let’s build something amazing together!
